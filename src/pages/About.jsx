        <p>I adopted Kitty (that's her name, yes, don't ask) while I was doing a course on React and Nodejs and found myself wanting to have a place so I could see photos of my cat everywhere. 
            I thought why not. In case you want to know random tidbits of my cat:
            <ul>
                <li>Likes Garfield</li>
                <li>She is terrible hunter but I love her anyway</li>
                <li>She likes destroying sofas</li>
                <li>She is orange so she is crazy</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
    </div>
    </div>
    )
